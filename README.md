World simulation

I believe all requirements were implemented


Things not finished due to time comstraints:

-Blocking main threads by Swing threads (this is why it is locked to 1000 runs / second - without UI it can easily run large map over 10000/sec)

-Boundary could be a separate class from RectangleMap

-Exceptions could be handled better

-UI with larger map sizes takes long time to open


May need external JSObject library from https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/releases
