World simulation

I believe all requirements were implemented


Things not finished due to time comstraints:

-Blocking main threads by Swing threads (this is why it is locked to 1000 runs / second - without UI it can run large map over 100000/sec)

-Boundary could be a separate class from RectangleMap

-Exceptions could be handled better

-UI with larger map sizes takes long time to open
